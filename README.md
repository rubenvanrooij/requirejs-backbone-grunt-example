# Require.js Backbone Grunt Example

This is a boilerplate example how to set up a basic Backbone application.
I think require.js helps a lot to write structured code, so here is my setup.
I like to use require.js sugar syntax (http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#sugar)

To run the app, clone the repo and then run

`npm install` followed by `bower install`
(if you don't have bower installed, do a `npm install bower -g` to install bower globally)


Then you should be able to run `grunt dev` which starts a local development server on port 8000.
